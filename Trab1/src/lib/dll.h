/**
 * \defgroup dll Doubly Linked List (dll)
 *
 * \details 
 *   This module implements a Doubly Linked List (DLL) in C. The DLL is statically allocated,
 *   with the maximum number of elements and element size passed as arguments to the initialization function.
 *   Each element in the DLL consists of a key (uint_16t) that uniquely identifies the element,
 *   and an array of unsigned chars that contains the element's data.
 *   
 *   The following functions are provided by this module:
 *   - MyDLLInit(): Initializes the DLL data structure.
 *   - MyDLLInsert(): Inserts a new element into the DLL.
 *   - MyDLLRemove(): Removes an element from the DLL identified by its key.
 *   - MyDLLFind(): Finds and returns the data associated with an element in the DLL given its key.
 *   - MyDLLFindNext(): Finds and returns the data associated with the element after the specified key in the DLL.
 *   - MyDLLFindPrev(): Finds and returns the data associated with the element before the specified key in the DLL.
 *   - MyDLLShowElements(): Displays all elements in the DLL.
 *   - MyDLLRandomFill(): Randomly fills the DLL with elements until it is full.
 *   - MyDLLClear(): Clears all elements from the DLL.
 *   
 *   The DLL supports the following operations:
 *   - Insertion of new elements.
 *   - Removal of elements by their keys.
 *   - Searching for elements by their keys.
 *   - Sorting the elements of the DLL in ascending order based on their keys.
 *   - Randomly filling the DLL with elements.
 *   - Clearing all elements from the DLL.
 *   - Displaying all elements in the DLL.
