# Lab Assignment 3: Vending Machine

## Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for the **Vending Machine State Machine**. This project simulates the behavior of a vending machine, allowing users to interact with it using buttons and LEDs. The vending machine manages credits, product selection, and various states of operation.

## Overview

The Vending Machine project provides the following functionalities:

- Insertion of credits using buttons.
- Browsing available products.
- Selecting a product for purchase.
- Displaying the current status of credits and selected product.
- Configuring and controlling LEDs to indicate the status of the vending machine.

## Modules

- **Vending Machine:** Implements the state machine for the vending machine, handling various states and transitions based on user interactions.

## Data Structures

- **VendingMachine:** Represents the state machine for the vending machine, including internal variables for credits, selected product, and price.

## Files

- **main.c:** Main function file containing the initialization code, button callback functions, LED configuration, and vending machine state handling.
- **config.h:** Header file defining GPIO pins, callback functions, and configuration parameters for the vending machine project.
- **src/sc_types.h:** Header file defining types and macros for the state machine implementation.
- **src-gen/VendingMachine.h:** Header file generated by the state machine tool, defining the interface for the vending machine state machine.

## Additional Information
