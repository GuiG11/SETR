/**
 * \defgroup sensor Smart Sensor Module (sensor)
 *
 * \details This module implements the UART communication and command processing functionalities
 * for the smart sensor. It allows the sensor to interact with external devices and systems
 * by sending and receiving commands via UART interface.
 * 
 * The smart sensor module provides the following features:
 *   - Initialization of UART communication buffers.
 *   - Transmission and reception of commands and data via UART.
 *   - Processing of commands received from external sources.
 *   - Emulation of sensor readings for temperature, humidity, and CO2 levels.
 * 
 * The module supports the following operations:
 *   - Initialization of UART buffers and sensor emulation parameters.
 *   - Parsing and processing of UART commands.
 *   - Generation of appropriate responses to commands.
 *   - Handling of UART interrupts and data transmission.
 *   - Calculation of checksums for command validation.
 * 
 * \note All communications are ASCII-based, allowing full interaction with the sensor
 * via a terminal or serial communication interface.
